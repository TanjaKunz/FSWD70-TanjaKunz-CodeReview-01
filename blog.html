					<h2 id="h2Main">Taxify is entering the e-scooter game </h2>

					<p>Estonian ride-hailing company Taxify will compete with Bird and Lime in Europe with its new brand of e-scooters, called <span>Bolt</span>, launching in Paris on Thursday.<br>
					<br>
					The company has rolled the scooter sharing service into its <span>mobile app</span>, which has attracted 10 million users in 25 countries since it launched in August 2013.<br>
					<br>
					A spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch it plans to release scooters in several other European and Australian cities where their app is already established, but will also launch in new markets where they’ve been unable to offer ride-hailing services because of regulatory roadblocks, including Germany and Spain.<br>
					<br>
					As of now, Taxify  has no plans to scoot into the US market.
